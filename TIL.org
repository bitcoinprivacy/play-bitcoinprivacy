* joda-time is not necessary in java 8 anymore. there is java.time now, and there is a scala.time wrapper. for now, we don't need any of them.
* fork in run in sbt is said to be the reason for play reload hanging sometimes

* there are multiple file backends for docker, 
  and we seem to use some version of devicemapper. It appears
  devicemapper has/had some bugs, and there might be performance 
  benefits to changing the backend. still, I believe it might be the
  wisest path to just keep using docker and wait for upstream to
  change, unless we keep having problems with this

* mysql needs space in /tmp, though you can change this directory in my.cnf
* tmpfs wasn't mounted on this server, but I guess it's a good idea, so I did it
* tmux saves its sockets in /tmp, so after mounting tmpfs I couldn't tmux attach, but
#+BEGIN_SRC 
 killall -10 tmux 
#+END_SRC
  made it reopen its sockets. I have never understood what sockets
  are, btw.
